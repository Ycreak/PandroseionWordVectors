# PandroseionWordVectors
Code accompanying the research paper *The Pandroseion: temple or courtyard?
a classical study augmented by word vectors in Ancient Greek*.

Used to visualise words denoting a holy site to check if Pausanias' use of the word ναός allows the interpretation of a courtyard. Visualisation tools tweaked for small corpora, so useful for the study of Classics. Results where interesting, though non-conventional when strictly looking at the way Word2Vec should be used.
